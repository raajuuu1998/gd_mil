*Tiles are embedded by a **frozen** foundation model and aggregated by gated-attention MIL into a slide representation `z`. During training, a gradient-reversal grade adversary **adversarially discourages** Gleason-grade information from `z`, steering the encoder toward prognostic morphology that is **complementary** to grade. The grade-disentangled imaging risk is then late-fused with clinical variables to produce the final BCR risk score.*

## TL;DR

Whether routine H&E carries prognostic signal **beyond Gleason grade** for biochemical recurrence (BCR) is unsettled, and the question is easily corrupted by a subtle evaluation leak: selecting checkpoints on the same fold used for scoring. We build a **leakage-free** benchmark on TCGA-PRAD, find that the **feature extractor — not the MIL aggregator — is what matters**, and show that no imaging-only model beats a clinical baseline. We then introduce **GD-MIL**, which removes grade from the imaging representation via a gradient-reversal adversary before fusing with clinical variables. GD-MIL is the **only** method that significantly beats the clinical baseline, and it stratifies patients into clinically distinct risk groups.

## Method

### Problem setup

BCR is a right-censored survival endpoint: each patient has a follow-up time and an event indicator. A whole-slide image is tiled into `N` patches embedded by a **frozen** foundation model `φ` into `F ∈ R^{N×d}` (`d = 1536` for UNI2-h, `1280` for Virchow2, `512` for ResNet50), with up to 2000 tiles per slide. The goal is a risk score that ranks patients by recurrence hazard, scored by the censored concordance index (C-index).

### Gated-attention MIL backbone

Each tile feature is projected to `h_i ∈ R^256`. Gated attention computes a normalized per-tile weight:

```
a_i = softmax_i( wᵀ ( tanh(V h_i) ⊙ σ(U h_i) ) ),    V, U ∈ R^{128×256},  w ∈ R^{128}
```

The `tanh` gate scores relevance and the `σ` gate scores inclusion; together they suppress uninformative tiles more effectively than a single gate. The slide representation is the layer-normalized attention-weighted sum `z = LayerNorm(Σ_i a_i h_i) ∈ R^256`.

### Grade-adversarial disentanglement

Much of what an imaging model learns is a proxy for Gleason grade — the variable clinicians already record — leaving little independent signal. GD-MIL attaches a grade adversary through a **Gradient Reversal Layer** (GRL):

```
ĝ = ψ( R_λ(z) ),        ∂R_λ/∂z = −λ I
L = L_cox(r_img) + λ · ‖ ĝ − g ‖²₂ ,     λ = 0.5
```

On the forward pass `R_λ` is the identity; on the backward pass it negates and scales the gradient. The encoder is thus pushed to keep `z` predictive of BCR while making `z` uninformative about grade — **adversarially discouraging** grade information rather than formally removing it. At inference the adversary is discarded.

### Late multimodal fusion

The grade-disentangled imaging risk `r_img` is concatenated with clinical variables (grade group, T-stage, age) and an L2-penalized Cox model produces the final GD-MIL risk score. Crucially, the fusion Cox is fitted **only on out-of-fold imaging risks**, so the leakage-free guarantee extends through the full pipeline.

### Leakage-free evaluation

A widespread pitfall selects checkpoints on the same fold used for scoring, inflating concordance. We avoid it: 5-fold stratified CV, with a 15% inner split per fold reserved **only** for early stopping and the outer test fold never used for selection. Each patient gets a single out-of-fold (OOF) risk; the C-index is computed once over all 487 OOF predictions, repeated across 5 seeds. Pairwise significance uses a paired bootstrap with 2000 resamples. Full derivation in [`docs/method.md`](docs/method.md).

```python
from gdmil import get_model, run_cv_oof, fit_fusion_oof
import pandas as pd, torch, glob, os

cohort = pd.read_csv("data/TCGA_PRAD/cohort.csv")
cache  = {("-".join(os.path.basename(f)[:-3].split("-")[:3])):
          torch.load(f, weights_only=False)["features"].float()
          for f in glob.glob("data/TCGA_PRAD/embeddings_uni2h/*.pt")}

# GD-MIL backbone: grade-adversarial OOF imaging risk
img_oof = run_cv_oof(lambda: get_model("gadvmil", 1536, lam=0.5),
                     lambda pid: cache[pid], cohort, 1536, "cuda",
                     use_grade_adv=True)

# late fusion with clinical variables -> final GD-MIL risk
final = fit_fusion_oof(cohort, img_oof)
```

## Results

All models use a **frozen** backbone with precomputed features; only the lightweight MIL head and the fusion Cox are trained. Every number is strictly out-of-fold, aggregated across 5 seeds. C-index is the primary metric.

### Benchmark — TCGA-PRAD (487 patients, 101 BCR events)

The MIL aggregator barely moves the needle; the feature extractor and multimodal fusion are what matter. **GD-MIL is the only method whose entire 95% CI lies above the clinical baseline.**

| Method        | Comparator       | Δc      | 95% CI            | *p*       |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------- | ----------------- | --------- |

### Figures

![C-index comparison](assets/plot1_cindex.png)
***Figure 1. C-index across all methods** (TCGA-PRAD). Error bars are 95% bootstrap CIs (2000 resamples); the dashed line marks the clinical Cox baseline (0.687). GD-MIL (orange) is the only method whose full CI clears the clinical baseline. All imaging-only methods fall below it — consistent with the non-significant p-values above.*

![Kaplan-Meier](assets/plot2_km.png)
***Figure 2. Risk stratification by median GD-MIL score.** High-risk (n=244, 76 events) vs low-risk (n=243, 25 events) separate immediately and stay separated for five years with no crossover (log-rank *p* < 0.0001). The three-fold difference in event rate (31.1% vs 10.3%) is consistent with a genuine difference in recurrence burden.*

![Attention — tight](assets/plot3_attention_tight.png)
***Figure 3. Attention maps, tighter colormap scale** (TCGA-2A-A8W3, ISUP 5, BCR=1). ABMIL (left) attends to a visually prominent region in the left-centre; GD-MIL (right) redirects to a distinct morphological region in the right-centre, qualitatively consistent with grade-disentangled attention. Single-case interpretation is necessarily illustrative.*

![Attention — broad](assets/plot4_attention_broad.png)
***Figure 4. Same case, broader colormap scale.** ABMIL produces near-zero attention across the slide; GD-MIL retains a sharp focal activation in the right-centre region, indicating more spatially concentrated attention weights. Cool = low, warm/orange = high.*

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raajuuu1998/gd-mil-bcr.git
cd gd-mil-bcr
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .          # exposes the `gdmil` package
```

Python ≥ 3.9, PyTorch ≥ 2.0. A single GPU is sufficient — the backbone is frozen and features are precomputed, so every experiment runs on modest hardware.

## Data

This repository operates on **precomputed tile embeddings**; raw WSIs and the foundation-model forward pass are upstream and not included. Slides are from TCGA-PRAD; BCR labels and clinical variables are derived from the TCGA clinical files.

Arrange the data as:

```
data/
└── TCGA_PRAD/
    ├── cohort.csv                       # patient_id, bcr_event, survival_time, grade_group, t_stage, age
    └── embeddings_uni2h/{pid}.pt        # dict: features[N,1536], coords[N,2]
        embeddings_virchow2/{pid}.pt     # dict: features[N,1280], coords[N,2]
        embeddings_resnet50/{pid}.pt     # dict: features[N, 512], coords[N,2]
```

Each `.pt` is a dict with keys `features` and `coords` (and any extra metadata).

**Feature-extraction details.** Tiles of 256 × 256 px were extracted at ≈ 1.0 µm/px (~10× magnification) from tissue found by an HSV filter, capped at 2000 tiles per slide, with coordinates saved alongside features. Three backbones were applied independently: [UNI2-h](https://huggingface.co/MahmoodLab/UNI2-h) (1536-d), Virchow2 (1280-d), and ImageNet ResNet50 (512-d). No stain normalization or augmentation was used.

## Notes and scope

- **Scope.** This release covers the single-cohort TCGA-PRAD setting reported in the paper. Cross-cohort external validation is future work.
- **Leakage-free by construction.** Checkpoint selection uses an inner validation split only; the test fold is never seen during selection, and the fusion Cox is fitted on OOF imaging risks. This is the central methodological contribution.
- **Attention maps are qualitative.** Figures 3-4 are hypothesis-generating; rigorous interpretation would require pathologist-annotated regions of interest.
- **Not included.** Raw WSIs and the foundation-model forward pass are not redistributed; obtain TCGA slides from their original sources and extract embeddings upstream.
